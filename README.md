## Sweets Technologies

The Sweets Technologies brand was created more than 15 years ago as a workshop with the goal of providing and replacing the services of foreign companies for the repair of confectionery equipment in the Russian and international markets. Accumulating experience and connections, the company has grown to the size of industrial production. Gradually, the company began producing its own confectionery equipment that meets international standards.

The production is equipped with a large fleet of metalworking equipment: lathes, milling machines, metal cutting machines and sheet processing machines.

The presence of universal equipment allows you to perform a wide range of complex operations that require accuracy, without involving third-party services.

The designing of new equipment is carried out by our own design bureau, the work of which is supplementing by our own development of electronic specialists.

The team that has developed over many years is distinguished by professionalism, responsibility and constant development, and an improvement in the approach to manufactured equipment.

We will help your company to gain a leading position in the market with its high-quality products!
